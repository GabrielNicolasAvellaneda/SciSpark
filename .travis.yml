# SciSpark provides this Travis CI configuration file to help contributors
# check build and test results for their pull requests

# 1. Choose OS (Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS Server Edition 64bit)
sudo: required
dist: trusty

# 2. Choose language and target JDKs for parallel  builds
language: scala

# 3. Versioning matrix.
#    We test two versions of spark 1.6.0 and 2.0.0
#    We test scala 2.10.6 on both and 2.11.2 on Spark 2.0.0
matrix:
  include:
    - scala: 2.10.6
      env:
        global:
          - SCALA_VERSION=2.10.6
        matrix:
          - SPARK_VERSION=1.6.0
          - SPARK_VERSION=2.0.0
    - scala: 2.11.2
      env:
        - SPARK_VERSION=2.0.0 SCALA_VERSION=2.11.2

# 3. Setup cache directory for SBT
cache:
  directories:
  - $HOME/.sbt
  - $HOME/.m2

# 4. Turn off notifications
notifications:
  email: false

# 5. Run maven sbt compile, check style, and test
install:
  - sbt scalastyle
  - sbt test:scalastyle

# 6. Run maven sbt compile, test, and generate coverage reports
script:
  - sbt clean
  - sbt -Dscala.version=$SCALA_VERSION -Dspark.version=$SPARK_VERSION compile
  - sbt -Dscala.version=$SCALA_VERSION -Dspark.version=$SPARK_VERSION coverage test

# 7. Generate the coverageReport for coveralls
after_success:
  - sbt coverageReport coveralls

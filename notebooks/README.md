# SciSpark Notebooks

In this folder you'll find some of the notebooks currently demonstrating how to use SciSpark in the Zeppelin environment. 

The file cloudElementsTab.txt can be accessed locally in the SciSpark Cloud elements Demo notebook to play with the data. 

Similarly, the data at https://github.com/SciSpark/SciSpark/tree/master/resources/merg can be accessed locally within the MCCUsecase-todate notebook, to play with the MCC search algorithm.
